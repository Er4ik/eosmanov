            shopfloor.io connects and visualizes your machinery,
            products and employees; either as the foundation
            of a scalable and secure Industry 4.0 system
            architecture or by connecting to your existing
            infrastructure.

        <h3>MY ROLE</h3>
        <p>
            This is the first big commercial project that started my journey as a full-time web developer. I was involved in product
            development, implementation of new features, code support and improvement. I also did code reviews and helped my
            colleagues on a regular basis. After six months of hard work, I was also responsible for onboarding new hires and
            supporting them through the early stages of the product. Moreover, I often prioritized tasks and distributed them among
            my colleagues.<br><br>
            The product has a microservice architecture, which was a big challenge for me to improve my programming skills. Also,
            using modern development tools gave me more energy and excitement for my daily hard work.
